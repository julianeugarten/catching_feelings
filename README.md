# Catching Feelings
This repo contains code and supplementary data for the _Catching Feelings_ Project.

It contains:

  - the Python code used to scrape the dataset in a Python-file.
  - the noun chunks in the comment data as identified with SpaCy, sorted by frequency in a csv-file.
  - the annotation guidelines used to create the annotation-set in a pdf.

    **To Add**
  - the Jupyter notebook used for pre-processing and exploring the comment data.
  - The annotations
  - A link to the Top2Vec topic model of the lengthier comments, which is too large to host on GitHub.
